# Spam Classifier using Logistic Regression

This project presents a spam classifier implemented with logistic regression, a widely-used machine learning algorithm. The primary objective is to discern between spam and non-spam (ham) messages, contributing to effective email filtering and communication security. Leveraging logistic regression's simplicity and efficiency, the classifier is designed for easy integration into diverse projects and serves as an educational tool for understanding classification algorithms.

**Key Features:**
1. **Logistic Regression Model:** The classifier employs logistic regression, a powerful algorithm for binary classification tasks, making it suitable for distinguishing between spam and ham messages effectively.

2. **Easy Integration:** Designed with simplicity in mind, the classifier can be seamlessly integrated into existing projects, allowing users to enhance their applications with spam-filtering capabilities effortlessly.

3. **Educational Purpose:** The project serves as an educational resource for individuals looking to grasp the fundamentals of machine learning classification, providing a practical example of logistic regression in action.

This lightweight and efficient spam classifier offer a practical solution for developers and learners alike, promoting understanding and utilization of logistic regression for real-world applications.
